# Manual Testing Assessment

## Q1 | Requirement Analysis
You have a shoe-selling e-commerce platform. The client wants to implement a new feature: **"Search"**. During the client meeting, they mentioned they wanted the search to be dynamic, capable of handling any keywords or specific text. As part of the initial process, you have the opportunity to ask detailed questions to clarify the requirements.  
**Task:** List 10 questions to ask the client, prioritizing them by importance.



## Q2 | Test Case Design
Based on the 10 questions identified in Q1, write test cases to verify the functionality of the search feature. Ensure that the test cases cover all identified scenarios and are structured appropriately.



## Q3 | Test Execution on Evershop
Assume that the development team has implemented the feature on the Evershop site (https://demo.evershop.io/). Execute your test cases on the site and generate a detailed report based on your findings.



## Q4 | Happy Path Journey
Perform the following actions to validate the search and cart functionality:
1. Search for the text **“Nike react phantom run flyknit 2”**.
2. Add a couple of **small-sized black products** to your cart.
3. Verify the cart for correct product details, quantities, and pricing.

Execute these steps through both the **API** and the **UI**, then:
- Provide feedback on your test analysis.
- Document any defects you encounter in detailed logs.
- Generate a comprehensive report based on your findings.
